# Stanford-RPG
A dating role-play game where players interact with NPCs shaped by real psychological patterns (like avoidant, anxious, and secure attachment). With dating stage-specific dialogues and emotional arcs, players not only experience romance, but also healing, reflection and the consequences of emotional choices.

# Note
This is my final project (built from scratch) for Stanford University's Code In Place 2025.

I will add in more NPCs when I have free time. 

# Disclaimer
While the character design (NPC profiles) is based on real psychological patterns, this game is not science-based.

# Features

 # Players can choose an NPC (a.k.a dating partner) to date
  
  There are a few dating partners players can choose from. 
  
  Each one is shaped by real psychological patterns (so some can be avoidant, others anxious, and the rest secure).
  
  Each dating partner has their own profile database as well where you can see their personality overview, relationship history, how their friends see them and what they secretly feel.
  
  # 5-Stage dating game
    
  This game has 5 stages which are progressive (so dialogues evolve as you get to know each other).
  
  However, players can suddenly exit early (so they won't get to Stage 5) if the dating partner sees them as a red flag.
  
  # End-of-game lesson
    
  Whether the player exits early or successfully finishes all stages, they’ll get to see a lesson which reflects how they responded to their dialogues with the dating partner.
    
  The intention is to help players become more aware of their tendencies and hopefully, they’ll be able to use the lesson in real life.
  
  # Emotional mini-arcs
    
  Players unlock mini-arcs after every stage. 
    
  The mini-arc is random, unique and emotional.
  
  Here, players can learn something new or appreciate life more.
    
  # Unique dating scenes
    
  The player and the dating partner meet in unique and different venues per stage.
