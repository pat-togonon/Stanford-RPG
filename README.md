# Stanford-RPG
A dating role-play game where players interact with NPCs shaped by real psychological patterns (like avoidant, anxious, and secure attachment). With dating stage-specific dialogues and emotional arcs, players not only experience romance, but also healing, reflection and the consequences of emotional choices.

# Note
This is my final project (built from scratch) for Stanford University's Code In Place 2025.

I will add in more NPCs when I have free time.
